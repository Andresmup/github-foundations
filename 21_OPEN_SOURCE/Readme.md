| Feature | InnerSource | OpenSource |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scope | Within an organization | Public global community |
| Accessibily | Limited to company employees | Open to anyone |
| Porpuse | Improve collaboration and efficiency internally | Share and collaborate on projects globally |
| Contribution | Employees of the organization | Anyone (developers, users, etc) |รง

## FORKING 
Forking repo's allow you to create a copy of a repo.

Forking allows to:

- Quickly apply bugs and patch fixes
- A separate repo to work on community contributtors. You can create cross-repo pull-requests to get accepted in the original repo

A forked repo is indicated underneath's it repo name.

You may prefer using a forked repo over the original. Some cases are when the original repo its abandon, and a fork become the go-to repo for the project

Forks help keep public projects alive, on the edge and collaborative

Using network graph unde repo insights you can often find community solutions to bugs or missing features

## DISCOVERABLE REPOS

Github repos can be set as public, making repos easily searchable on Github and via search engines.

Public repos serve a community purpose for knowledge sharing, educational resources and open-sources projects.

Beside just search Github curates content via their community pages:
- https://github.com/explore
- https://github.com/trending

Github provides a robust search that lets us not only search by repo name but the contents of their repos

Github also has several advanced search options such:
- Owner
- Size
- Number of followers
- Number of forks
- Number of stars
- Date created
- Date pushed
- Topic
- License
- Archived
- Public
- Private
- *Advance search*

> [!TIP]
> Search syntax also supports: regular expressions, wildcards, NOT, OR, AND, multiple terms and more
