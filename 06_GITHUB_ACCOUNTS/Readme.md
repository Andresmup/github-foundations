# GITHUB ACCOUNTS

Accounts on GitHub allow you to organize and control access to code. 
There are three types of accounts on GitHub..

 - Personal accounts
 - Organization accounts
 - Enterprise accounts

Every person who uses GitHub signs into a personal account. An organization account enhances collaboration between multiple personal accounts, and an enterprise account allows central management of multiple organizations.

## PERSONAL

These are individual accounts with a username and profile.

Every person who uses GitHub.com signs in to a personal account. Your personal account is your identity on GitHub.com and has a username and profile.

Your personal account can own resources such as repositories, packages, and projects. Any time you take any action on GitHub.com, such as creating an issue or reviewing a pull request, the action is attributed to your personal account. They can use either Github Free or Github Pro.


All personal accounts can own an unlimited number of public and private repositories, with an unlimited number of collaborators on those repositories.


> [!TIP]
> Personal accounts are intended for humans, but you can create accounts to automate activity on GitHub. This type of account is called a machine user. For example, you can create a machine user account to automate continuous integration (CI) workflows.

### Personal features

With a Github Personal account you can have a public profile and also host your own public website.

Repos urls for personal account looks like
```sh 
https://github.com/Andresmup/github-foundations #Github domain, follow by username follow by repo name
```

### Personal plans comparison

## ORGANIZATION

Organizations are shared accounts where an unlimited number of people can collaborate across many projects at once.

The can also own resources like repositories, packages, and projects. But the are managed through individual personal accounts.

> [!NOTE]  
> You cannot sign into an organization. Instead, each person signs into their own personal account, and any actions the person takes on organization resources are attributed to their personal account.

Each personal account can be a member of multiple organizations.

The personal accounts within an organization can be given different roles in the organization, which grant different levels of access to the organization and its data. 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> All members can collaborate with each other in repositories and projects, but only organization owners and security managers can manage the settings for the organization and control access to the organization's data with sophisticated security and administrative features.

## ENTREPRISE

GitHub Enterprise Cloud and GitHub Enterprise Server include enterprise accounts. 

Which allow administrators to centrally manage policy and billing for multiple organizations and enable innersourcing between the organizations.

Your enterprise account must have a handle, like an organization or user account on GitHub.

In the enterprise settings, enterprise owners can invite existing organizations to join your enterprise account, transfer organizations between enterprise accounts, or create new organizations.

Your enterprise account allows you to manage and enforce policies for all the organizations owned by the enterprise. 

Each enterprise policy controls the options available for a policy at the organization level. You can choose to not enforce a policy, which allows organization owners to configure the policy for the organization, or you can choose from a set of options to enforce for all organizations owned by your enterprise. 

### Billing for enterprise

The bill for your enterprise account includes the monthly cost for each member of your enterprise. 

The bill includes any paid licenses in organizations outside of your enterprise account, subscriptions to apps in GitHub Marketplace, additional paid services for your enterprise like data packs for Git Large File Storage, and usage for GitHub Advanced Security.
