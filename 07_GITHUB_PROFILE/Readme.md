# GITHUB PROFILE

Your profile page tells people the story of your work through the repositories you're interested in, the contributions you've made, and the conversations you've had.

You can add personal information about yourself in your bio, like previous places you've worked, projects you've contributed to, or interests you have that other people may like to know about. 

> [!NOTE]  
> If you add a README file to the root of a public repository with the same name as your username, that README will automatically appear on your profile page. You can edit your profile README with GitHub Flavored Markdown to create a personalized section on your profile. 

You can also set a status on your profile to provide information about your availability. 

People who visit your profile can also see the following information:

 - Profile picture and bio, an profile image can be upload and a short bio written.

### Achievements

Achievements celebrate specific events and actions that happen on GitHub. They will appear as small badges listed in the sidebar of your profile.

Clicking or hovering on an achievement will show a detailed view that hints at how the achievement was earned, with a short description and links to the contributing events. 

The event links will only be visible to users that have access to the repository or organization that the event took place in. Event links will appear inaccessible to all users without access.

> [!TIP]
> Some achievements not only have the base version, but also tiers. For example by earning more stars in a repo (16, 128, 512, 4096)

### Pinning items

You can pin gists and repositories to your profile so other people can quickly see your best work.

You can pin a public repository if you own the repository or you've made contributions to the repository within the last year. Commits to forks don't count as contributions, so you can't pin a fork that you don't own. 

You can pin any public gist you own.

Pinned items include important information about the item, like the number of stars a repository has received or the first few lines of a gist. Once you pin items to your profile, the "Pinned" section replaces the "Popular repositories" section on your profile. You can reorder the items in the "Pinned" section. 

> [!NOTE]  
> You can select up to six repositories and gists, combined.


## CONTRIBUTIONS

Your GitHub profile shows off your pinned repositories, Achievements, and a graph of your repository contributions over the past year.

Your contribution graph and Achievements show activity from public repositories. You can choose to show activity from both public and private repositories, <ins> with specific details of your activity in private repositories anonymized. </ins>

> [!NOTE]  
> Commits will only appear on your contributions graph if the email address you used to author the commits is connected to your account on GitHub.

On your profile page, certain actions count as contributions:

 - Committing to a repository's default branch or gh-pages branch
 - Creating a branch
 - Opening an issue
 - Opening a discussion
 - Answering a discussion
 - Proposing a pull request
 - Submitting a pull request review

> [!NOTE]  
>  - When rebasing commits, the original authors of the commit and the person who rebased the commits, whether on the command line or on GitHub.com, receive contribution credit.
>  - If you merged multiple personal accounts, issues, pull requests, and discussions will not be attributed to the new account and will not appear on your contribution graph.


If you use GitHub Enterprise Server and your enterprise owner enables unified contributions, you can send enterprise contribution counts to your GitHub.com profile. 


### Contributions calendar
Your contributions calendar shows your contribution activity.

You can view contributions from specific times, just click on a day's square to show the contributions made during that 24-hour period. Press Shift and click on another day's square to show contributions made during that time span.

How contribution event times are calculated:
 - Commits use the time zone information in the commit timestamp.
 - Pull requests and issues opened on GitHub use your browser's time zone.

### Activity overview
When you enable the activity overview section on your profile, viewers can see more information about the types of contributions you make and repositories you're most active in. 

A viewer can only see information in the activity overview about repositories they have read access to. Once enabled, a viewer can also filter your contribution graph and activity timeline for a specific organization. 

> [!TIP]
> To enable this feature go to your profile -> go to contributions graph -> select the contribution settings dropdown menu -> click activity overview

### Contribute activity

The contribution activity section includes a detailed timeline of your work, including commits you've made or co-authored, pull requests you've proposed, and issues you've opened.

You can see your contributions over time by either clicking Show more activity at the bottom of your contribution activity or by clicking the year you're interested in viewing on the right side of the page.

Important moments, like the date you joined an organization, proposed your first pull request, or opened a high-profile issue, are highlighted in your contribution activity.


## ORGANIZATION'S PROFILE

Your organization's profile page shows basic information about your organization.

You can optionally choose to add a description, location, website, and email address for your organization, and pin important repositories. You can share information about how to engage with your organization by creating an organization profile README for both public users and members of the organization.

> [!NOTE]
> Organizations that use GitHub Enterprise Cloud can confirm their organization's identity and display a "Verified" badge on their organization's profile page by verifying the organization's domains with GitHub. 

Members of your organization who are signed into GitHub, can select a member or public view of the README and pinned repositories when they visit your organization's profile page.

> [!TIP]  
> You can set up a public organization profile (for non members) and a private one (only organization members)

Adding a public organization profile:
 - If your organization does not already have a public `.github` repository, create a public `.github` repository.
 - In your organization's `.github` repository, create a `README.md` file in the profile folder.

Adding a member-only organization profile
 - If your organization does not already have a `.github-private` repository, create a private repository called `.github-private`.
 - In your organization's `.github-private` repository, create a `README.md` file in the profile folder.


## PRIVATE PROFILE

A private profile displays only limited information, and hides some activity.

To hide parts of your profile page, you can make your profile private. This also hides your activity in various social features on GitHub.com. A private profile hides information from all users, and there is currently no option to allow specified users to see your activity.

After making your profile private, you can still view all your information when you visit your own profile.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Private profiles cannot receive sponsorships under GitHub Sponsors. To be eligible for GitHub Sponsors, your profile cannot be private.


### Differences between private and public profiles

When your profile is private, the following content is hidden from your profile page:

 - Achievements and highlights.
 - Activity overview and activity feed.
 - Contribution graph.
 - Follower and following counts.
 - Follow and Sponsor buttons.
 - Organization memberships.
 - Stars, projects, packages, and sponsoring tabs.
 - Your pronouns.

> [!NOTE]  
> When your profile is private, some optional fields are still publicly visible, such as the README, biography, and profile photo.

## PROFILE README

You can share information about yourself with the community on GitHub.com by creating a profile README. GitHub shows your profile README at the top of your profile page.

You decide what information to include in your profile README, so you have full control over how you present yourself on GitHub. 

You can format text and include emoji, images, and GIFs in your profile README by using GitHub Flavored Markdown.

### Prerequisites

 - You've created a repository with a name that matches your GitHub username.
 - The repository is public.
 - The repository contains a file named README.md in its root.
