# GITHUB PROFILE

Your profile page tells people the story of your work through the repositories you're interested in, the contributions you've made, and the conversations you've had.

You can add personal information about yourself in your bio, like previous places you've worked, projects you've contributed to, or interests you have that other people may like to know about. 

> [!NOTE]  
> If you add a README file to the root of a public repository with the same name as your username, that README will automatically appear on your profile page. You can edit your profile README with GitHub Flavored Markdown to create a personalized section on your profile. 

You can also set a status on your profile to provide information about your availability. 

People who visit your profile can also see the following information:

 - Repositories and gists you own or contribute to. You can showcase your best work by pinning repositories and gists to your profile. For more information, see "Pinning items to your profile."
 - Repositories you've starred and organized into lists. For more information, see "Saving repositories with stars."
 - An overview of your activity in organizations, repositories, and teams you're most active in. For more information, see "Showing an overview of your activity on your profile."Badges and Achievements that highlight your activity and show if you use GitHub Pro or participate in programs like the Arctic Code Vault, GitHub Sponsors, or the GitHub Developer Program. For more information, see "Personalizing your profile."
 - Your pronouns if you've set them. For more information, see "Personalizing your profile.
 - Mutual connections you share with someone who is viewing your profile. The person viewing your profile can see which of the people they follow are also followed by you.

## CONTRIBUTIONS

Your GitHub profile shows off your pinned repositories, Achievements, and a graph of your repository contributions over the past year.

Your contribution graph and Achievements show activity from public repositories. You can choose to show activity from both public and private repositories, <ins> with specific details of your activity in private repositories anonymized. </ins>

> [!NOTE]  
> Commits will only appear on your contributions graph if the email address you used to author the commits is connected to your account on GitHub.

On your profile page, certain actions count as contributions:

 - Committing to a repository's default branch or gh-pages branch
 - Creating a branch
 - Opening an issue
 - Opening a discussion
 - Answering a discussion
 - Proposing a pull request
 - Submitting a pull request review

> [!NOTE]  
>  - When rebasing commits, the original authors of the commit and the person who rebased the commits, whether on the command line or on GitHub.com, receive contribution credit.
>  - If you merged multiple personal accounts, issues, pull requests, and discussions will not be attributed to the new account and will not appear on your contribution graph.


If you use GitHub Enterprise Server and your enterprise owner enables unified contributions, you can send enterprise contribution counts to your GitHub.com profile. 


### CContributions calendar
Your contributions calendar shows your contribution activity.

You can view contributions from specific times, just click on a day's square to show the contributions made during that 24-hour period. Press Shift and click on another day's square to show contributions made during that time span.

How contribution event times are calculated:
 - Commits use the time zone information in the commit timestamp.
 - Pull requests and issues opened on GitHub use your browser's time zone.

### Activity overview
When you enable the activity overview section on your profile, viewers can see more information about the types of contributions you make and repositories you're most active in. 

A viewer can only see information in the activity overview about repositories they have read access to. Once enabled, a viewer can also filter your contribution graph and activity timeline for a specific organization. 

> [!TIP]
> To enable this feature go to your profile -> go to contributions graph -> select the contribution settings dropdown menu -> click activity overview

### Contribute activity

The contribution activity section includes a detailed timeline of your work, including commits you've made or co-authored, pull requests you've proposed, and issues you've opened.

You can see your contributions over time by either clicking Show more activity at the bottom of your contribution activity or by clicking the year you're interested in viewing on the right side of the page.

Important moments, like the date you joined an organization, proposed your first pull request, or opened a high-profile issue, are highlighted in your contribution activity.
