# PROJECTS

Github Projects is a planning and tracking tool when on working on Github Repo.

A project has an adaptable view that can be changed at anytime between:
- Spreadsheet (Table)
- Taskboard (Board)
- Roadmap (Roadmap)

Projects directly integrates with Issues and Pull Requests.

Project have build-in workflows to automate common actions.

## ABOUT PROJECTS

A project is an adaptable spreadsheet, task-board, and road map that integrates with your issues and pull requests on GitHub to help you plan and track your work effectively. 

You can create and customize multiple views by filtering, sorting, grouping your issues and pull requests, visualize work with configurable charts, and add custom fields to track metadata specific to your team. 

### Staying up-to-date

<ins>Your projects are built from the issues and pull requests you add, creating direct references between your project and your work.</ins>

> [!WARNING]  
> Must remember:
> - Information is synced automatically to your project as you make changes, updating your views and charts.
> - This integration works both ways, so that when you change information about a pull request or issue in your project, the pull request or issue reflects that information. 

### Adding metadata to your items
You can use custom fields to add metadata to your issues, pull requests, and draft issues and build a richer view of item attributes.

<ins>Youâ€™re not limited to the built-in metadata (assignee, milestone, labels, etc.) that currently exists for issues and pull requests.</ins>

For example, you can add the following metadata as custom fields:
- A date field to track target ship dates.
- A number field to track the complexity of a task.
- A single select field to track whether a task is Low, Medium, or High priority.
- A text field to add a quick note.
- An iteration field to plan work week-by-week, including support for breaks.

## LAYOUT OPTIONS
A project is componsed of multiple views, you can add more views to your project.

Each view's layout can be changed at anytime to accommodate the project use-case
- **Table**: This layout is great for your traditional ticket tracker and large amount of task
- **Board**: This layout is great for your agile tasks and understand clearly the state of issues
- **Roadmap**: This layout is great for planning based on a timeline

For your layout you can configure your data based on multiple options
- **Fields**: Add custom data fields to each project item (eg: status, assignees)
- **Column by**: Organize board columns based on specific fields (eg: status)
- **Group by**: Group by items into rows based on a chosen field (eg: assignee, label)
- **Sort by**: Define the order of items within columns or groups (eg: by priority)
- **Fields sum**: Show a summary or total of a particular field for all items in a column/group
- **Slice by**: Filter visible items on the board by specific field (eg: milestone, label)
- **Zoom level**: *(Roadmap only)* Adjust the view of the roadmap timeline (daily, monthly, quarterly)
- **Dates**: *(Roadmap only)* Set and view start and end date for each time on the roadmap

Remeber about items that:
- Your Github Project Items have custom fields
- You can create new fields
- Provide options to easily fill in the fields

8. Click Create.

Creating draft issues

Draft issues can have a title, text body, assignees, and any custom fields from your project. In order to populate the repository, labels, or milestones for a draft issue, you must first convert the draft issue to an issue. 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Draft issues are useful to quickly capture ideas. Unlike issues and pull requests that are referenced from your repositories, draft issues exist only in your project.

1. Place your cursor in the bottom row of the project, next to the .
2. Type your idea, then press Enter.
3.To add body text, click on the title of the draft issue. In the markdown input box that appears, enter the text for the draft issue body, then click Save.


## FIELDS

You can use text fields to include notes or any other freeform text in your project.

### Text and number fields

Text fields can be used in filters, for example: `field:"exact text"`. Text fields and item titles will also be used if you filter for text without specifying a field.

### Date fields
You can filter for date values using the YYYY-MM-DD format, for example: `date:2022-07-01`. 

<ins>If your project makes use of date fields, you can use the roadmap layout to view items on a timeline.</ins>

### Single select fields
You can create single select fields with multiple options, each with a description and a color, that can be selected from a dropdown menu.

You can filter by your single select fields by specifying the option, for example: `fieldname:option`.

You can filter for multiple values by providing a comma-separated list of options, for example: `fieldname:option1,option2`

Single select fields can contain up to 50 options.

### Iteration fields
You can create iterations to plan upcoming work and group items.

You can create an iteration field to associate items with specific repeating blocks of time. 

Iterations can be set to any length of time, can include breaks, and can be individually edited to modify name and date range.

With projects, you can group by iteration to visualize the balance of upcoming work, use filters to focus on a single iteration, and sort by iteration.

When you first create an iteration field, three iterations are automatically created. You can add additional iterations and make other changes on your project's settings page.

<ins>If your project makes use of iteration fields, you can use the roadmap layout to view items on a timeline.</ins>

### Tracks and Tracked by fields

You can view the subtasks of the issues in your projects.

You can enable the Tracks and Tracked by fields on your projects to see the relationships between your issues as you add subtasks in tasklists. 

The Tracked by field can be used to group items, creating a view that clearly shows the subtasks of each issue and the work required to complete them. 

You can also filter by the Tracked by field to display only items that are tracked by specific issues. Either start typing "tracked-by" and select an issue from the list or, if you know the repository and issue number, you can type the filter below in full. For example: `tracked-by:"<OWNER>/<REPO>#<ISSUE NUMBER>"`

### Delete and rename fields

You can delete and rename your custom fields under your repo project settings.

## AUTOMATING YOUR PROJECT
