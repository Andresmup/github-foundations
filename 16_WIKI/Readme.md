# WIKI

A Wiki is a collaborative way to quickly create documentation with multiple nested pages.

A wiki would serve as a knowledge base for your repo or organization.

To use wikis:
> Go to repo settings -> Features -> Ckeck Wiki (Optionally restrict editing to collaborators only)

*Now you just can go to the Wiki tab of your repo and Create the first page.*

> [!NOTE]  
> Github Wikis can be used for Free in Public Repos


When you create a page you can use various markup languages:
- AsciiDoc
- Creole
- Markdown
- MediaWiki
- Org-mode
- Pod
- Rdoc
- Textile
- reStructuredText

Here is an example of how to link other pages, by providing the page title as the link.
```md
[Home Page] (Home) #Generate a direct link to the home page in this wiki page
```

## VISIBILITY
> [!NOTE]  
> Remember:
> - For public repos: the wiki is available to the public
> - For private repos: only people with access to the repository can access it
