When you create a new category you will choose a Discussion Format:
- **Open ended discussion**: no voting of best answer, just open discussion

- **Announcement**: admins or maintainers can only post, anyone can reply
- **Poll**: Create a Poll and let numbers vote

Categories can be grouped into sections

For Q&A Discussions Formats you can mark an answer as the recommended answer regardless of upvotes to help direct which question you think is the most credible.


## PIN DISCUSSIONS

You can pin a discussion in the discussions home page of a specific category

You can customize the look of a pinned discussion.
